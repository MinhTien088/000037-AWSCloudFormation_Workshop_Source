#### Custom Resources

+ You can extend CloudFormation’s usability with custom resources by delegating the work to be done to a specially designed Lambda function, to interact with the CloudFormation service.

+ In the body of your code, you’ll implement constructors, update, and delete, and the function that sends feedback about the state of the activity.

+ In this first lab, you will create a custom resource that can generate an SSH key and store it in the SSM parameter store.
