#### Basic CloudFormation

- After completing the lab we should already feel a bit more familiar with AWS CloudFormation by creating a CloudFormation template and knowing a few more basic CloudFormation features, and how to test templates.
    
- At the same time, we also learned how to launch a CloudFormation template using the AWS CLI to create a simple Stack.
    
- If you feel confident with the content of part 1, move on to part 2 of the Workshop to learn more great features of CloudFormation!
